Editing mode keeps switching from "insert" to "overwrite". I couldn't find documentation as to how to change the mode. The only solution that I have is to close and reopen Notepad++. On open, the mode is "insert" by default.

Two issues:
[1] Is the mode switch something that I inadvertantly did, and
[2] Some idenfification of what to do should be easily searchable in the documentation.
